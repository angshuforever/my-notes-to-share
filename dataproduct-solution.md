# Manufacturing KPI Data Product on Databricks:
## A Strategic Proposal for PS Data Platform Leveraging MAP Data

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared for:** [Your Team/Company Name]

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Our organization operates a **Manufacturing Analytics Platform (MAP)** (Department A) on Databricks, which efficiently ingests raw sensor data directly from factory sources via native connectors. MAP performs crucial canonical operations to process this data into a standardized, clean form.

The **PS Data Platform** (Department B) is now tasked with leveraging this canonical sensor data from MAP to build a dedicated **Data Mart of Manufacturing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. Key KPIs include, but are not limited to, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), Line Structure (incorporating Item Part Number - IPN, Manufacturing process, and logical data relationships), and other related metrics.

This KPI Data Mart will reside in a separate Unity Catalog instance (or distinct schemas within a shared Unity Catalog) managed by PS Data Platform and will be exposed to end-users. The objective is to provide actionable KPI values, identify correlations between KPIs, and offer rich, discoverable metadata. The final data product must be easily discoverable and consumable through a data glossary and potentially a marketplace.

**Key Challenges & Requirements for PS Data Platform:**

1.  **Cost Minimization:** Achieve the best total cost of ownership by minimizing data duplication between MAP and PS Data Platform, avoiding redundant data movement, and optimizing compute resources.
2.  **Efficient Data Leverage:** Seamlessly consume the canonical data produced by MAP without unnecessary data copying.
3.  **Robust KPI Development:** Build reliable pipelines to calculate OEE, Line Structure, and other manufacturing KPIs, integrating IPN, manufacturing process, and logical data relationships.
4.  **Metadata & Discoverability:** Provide comprehensive metadata (definitions, lineage, data quality) for all KPIs, ensuring discoverability via a data glossary/marketplace.
5.  **Deployment & Automation:** Define structured deployment models (development, testing, production) and strategies for automating data gathering and transformation processes, always with a focus on cost optimization.
6.  **Customer Cost Model:** Develop a conceptual cost model for pricing the platform and its data products if exposed to external customers in the future.

**Architectural Component Breakdown:**

*   **Factory Edge/Sensors:** The origin point for raw manufacturing data.
*   **Department A: Manufacturing Analytics Platform (MAP):**
    *   **Raw Sensor Data (Bronze Layer):** The initial, immutable ingest of raw sensor telemetry.
    *   **Canonical Sensor Data (Silver Layer):** Processed, cleaned, and standardized data from the Bronze layer. This represents MAP's high-quality data product.
    *   **Unity Catalog (MAP's Catalog):** Centralized governance for MAP's data assets, managing schemas, access, and metadata.
    *   **Shared Delta Tables (via Delta Sharing):** MAP explicitly shares its canonical Silver layer Delta tables with PS Data Platform. This is the cornerstone of the **zero-copy data architecture**, eliminating physical data movement between departments.
*   **Department B: PS Data Platform (KPI Data Product):**
    *   **External Tables:** PS Data Platform creates references in its own Unity Catalog to MAP's shared tables. These external tables behave identically to native Delta tables, allowing PS Data Platform to query MAP's data directly without duplication.
    *   **Derived KPI Data (Gold Layer - OEE, Line Structure):** This layer embodies the core value proposition of PS Data Platform. DLT pipelines (or Spark jobs) will consume the shared Silver data, enrich it with critical master data (e.g., IPN, machine hierarchies), calculate OEE components (availability, performance, quality), and define precise line structures. This transformed data is stored in PS Data Platform's own Delta tables (Gold layer).
    *   **Predictive/Correlation Models (Optional):** Leveraging Databricks' MLflow for building, tracking, and deploying machine learning models to identify correlations between KPIs or predict future trends.
    *   **KPI Metrics Store/Materialized Views:** For optimized query performance for dashboards and reporting, Databricks SQL's Materialized Views will pre-aggregate frequently accessed KPI data.
    *   **Unity Catalog (PS DP's Catalog):** Manages PS Data Platform's Gold layer tables, views, and external tables. This is where rich metadata, lineage, and fine-grained access controls are defined for the KPI Data Product.
    *   **Data Glossary / Marketplace:** A user-friendly interface, built upon Unity Catalog's discovery capabilities, potentially augmented by external tools, providing clear definitions, lineage, and access to the KPI data product.
    *   **Internal End Users:** Consume the KPI data through various means (Databricks SQL, BI tools, custom applications).
    *   **External Customers:** A future potential user group, requiring a well-defined access mechanism and a robust cost model.
*   **Cross-Cutting Services:**
    *   **Unity Catalog (Central Governance):** The foundational layer for metadata management, data discovery, and security across both departments.
    *   **Databricks Workflows (Orchestration):** Schedules and manages DLT pipelines and other batch jobs across all deployment environments (Dev/Test/Prod).
    *   **Lakehouse Monitoring & Alerting:** Provides observability for data quality, pipeline health, and resource utilization using native Databricks tools, ensuring proactive issue resolution.
    *   **Deployment Environments (Dev/Test/Prod):** Structured environments facilitating a robust software development lifecycle.
    *   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automating code deployment and testing across the various environments.

### 2.2. Implementation Strategy

The implementation will proceed in phases, focusing on establishing a solid foundation before expanding capabilities.

#### Phase 1: MAP Data Sharing Setup (Collaboration between MAP & PS DP)

1.  **MAP Ensures Data Product Readiness:** MAP must ensure its Silver layer Delta tables are stable, well-defined, and comprehensively documented within Unity Catalog (using comments, tags, and data quality expectations).
2.  **MAP Establishes Delta Share:** MAP will create a Delta Share for its canonical Silver layer tables (e.g., `map_catalog.production.sensor_readings`, `map_catalog.production.equipment_master`). Read access will be granted explicitly to PS Data Platform as a recipient.
3.  **PS Data Platform Creates External Tables:** PS Data Platform will then create corresponding External Tables in its own Unity Catalog (e.g., `ps_data_catalog.map_shared.sensor_readings`), referencing MAP's shared tables. This enables seamless, zero-copy access to the canonical data.

#### Phase 2: PS Data Platform KPI Development & Deployment

1.  **Deployment Models (Dev/Test/Prod):**
    *   **Unity Catalog Structure:** Separate catalogs will be used for each environment (e.g., `dev_ps_data_catalog`, `test_ps_data_catalog`, `prod_ps_data_catalog`) to provide strong isolation and control.
    *   **Shared Data Access:** In Dev/Test environments, PS Data Platform will typically access the `prod_map_catalog`'s shared tables. If greater isolation for testing is required, MAP could provide dedicated test shares.
    *   **Workspace/Cluster Separation:**
        *   **Development:** Dedicated development workspaces and clusters for interactive coding and experimentation.
        *   **Test:** A dedicated test workspace/clusters for integration testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).
        *   **Production:** A highly optimized, stable production workspace/clusters for running pipelines and serving data to end-users.
2.  **Automated Data Gathering & Formation (Cost-Optimized):**

    *   **Must-Have Implementations for Best Cost of Ownership:**
        *   **Delta Live Tables (DLT) for Gold Layer:** DLT is paramount for building declarative, resilient, and cost-efficient ETL pipelines.
            *   **Benefits:** Automated retries, schema enforcement/evolution, built-in data quality checks (`EXPECT` clauses), and automatic infrastructure management. These features inherently reduce operational cost and manual engineering effort.
            *   **Cost Optimization:** Utilize **Triggered DLT pipelines** for batch processing of KPIs, rather than `CONTINUOUS` mode, unless near real-time updates are absolutely critical. Triggered mode consumes compute only when processing new data, significantly saving costs.
        *   **Serverless Databricks SQL Endpoints:** For serving the Gold layer and Materialized Views to internal and external end-users.
            *   **Benefits:** Instantaneous start times, dynamic auto-scaling to zero when idle, resulting in significant savings on idle compute costs compared to always-on clusters.
        *   **Databricks Workflows:** For reliable and automated orchestration of DLT pipelines, batch jobs, and notebook executions.
            *   **Cost Optimization:** Schedule workflows efficiently to run only when new source data is available or at optimal intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) to prevent unnecessary compute usage.
    *   **Good-to-Have Implementations (Can be deferred/avoided to reduce initial cost):**
        *   **Advanced Data Validation:** Beyond DLT expectations, integrating specialized third-party data quality tools can be a "good-to-have" but may be postponed if budget is tight or initial data quality from MAP is deemed sufficient.
        *   **Complex Machine Learning for Correlations:** Initially, basic statistical analysis or simpler correlation methods might suffice. Postpone the development of complex ML models (e.g., deep learning for anomaly detection) if the business value isn't immediately clear and significant compute/data science effort is a concern.
        *   **Custom UI for Data Glossary:** While highly beneficial, a bespoke user interface for a data glossary can be an added expense. Initially, leverage Unity Catalog Explorer and well-documented Databricks SQL notebooks as a robust starting point.
3.  **KPI Calculation Logic:**
    *   **OEE:** Develop DLT pipelines that join the shared sensor data with production schedules, equipment status, and quality control logs. Define intermediate metrics for `availability`, `performance`, and `quality`, then combine them to calculate OEE.
    *   **Line Structure:** Create robust dimension tables (e.g., `dim_machines`, `dim_lines`, `dim_ipn`) by combining shared sensor data with internal master data. This will define the hierarchical and logical relationships necessary for understanding manufacturing lines.
    *   **Data Enrichment:** Integrate essential master data (e.g., product master, routing information, process flows) from other systems using Unity Catalog external locations or further Delta Sharing if applicable.
4.  **Metadata & Governance (Must-Have):**
    *   **Unity Catalog:** Register all Gold layer tables, views, and Materialized Views within PS Data Platform's Unity Catalog.
    *   **Comprehensive Comments:** Document every table, column, and DLT pipeline with clear business definitions, source systems, and calculation logic. This is critical for data literacy and trust.
    *   **Tagging:** Utilize Unity Catalog tags (e.g., `domain:manufacturing`, `kpi:oee`, `data_owner:ps_data_platform`) for enhanced data discoverability and categorization.
    *   **Lineage:** Leverage Unity Catalog's automatic lineage tracking (especially through DLT) to provide transparency on data origins and transformations.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement granular access control via Unity Catalog, including row-level and column-level security if dictated by data sensitivity requirements.
5.  **Data Glossary / Marketplace (Must-Have, leveraging built-in features first):**
    *   **Unity Catalog Explorer:** This will be the primary tool for users to discover available data assets, view their metadata, and understand data lineage.
    *   **Databricks SQL Dashboards:** Create example dashboards demonstrating key KPIs, providing contextual insights and quick access for business users.
    *   **Data Dictionary Notebooks:** Develop dedicated Databricks notebooks explaining each KPI in detail, including its calculation methodology, business context, and potential uses.
6.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Must-Have for Production Readiness):**
    *   Automate the deployment of DLT pipelines, notebooks, and SQL definitions from a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git) to Development, Test, and Production environments using tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.
    *   Include automated tests for data quality and KPI calculation accuracy within the pipeline.

### 2.3. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                   | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Quality Issues from MAP**       | Establish strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with MAP regarding data quality. PS Data Platform implements DLT `EXPECT` statements on the incoming shared external tables for immediate validation. Alerting mechanisms will be set up for `EXPECT` failures. Regular communication and feedback loops with MAP on data quality are essential. |
| **Schema Changes from MAP**            | MAP must provide advance notification of any schema changes to their shared tables. PS Data Platform's DLT pipelines should be designed with schema evolution in mind (e.g., using `schema_inference = "true"` and `schema_evolution_mode = "append_new_columns"`). Automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline will catch unexpected schema breaks.       |
| **Dependency on MAP Uptime/Performance** | Proactively monitor MAP's data availability and performance metrics. Implement robust retry mechanisms within PS Data Platform's DLT pipelines. Develop contingency plans for delayed or unavailable data (e.g., historical data backfilling strategies). Establish clear dependency and escalation procedures with the MAP team.              |
| **Cost Overruns (Compute)**            | Aggressive use of **Serverless SQL Endpoints** and **Triggered DLT Pipelines**. Optimize SQL/Spark code for the Databricks Photon engine. Continuously monitor Databricks Usage UI for anomalies. Implement auto-termination for interactive clusters. Regularly review and optimize cluster configurations and DLT pipeline settings. Implement data retention policies for older, less frequently accessed data. |
| **Data Security & Compliance**         | Leverage Unity Catalog for fine-grained access control (table, column, and row-level if required). Implement data masking for sensitive data elements. Conduct regular security audits and ensure full compliance with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).                                                                   |
| **KPI Definition Drift**               | Centralize all KPI definitions and calculation logic within Unity Catalog comments and the data glossary. Ensure robust version control for DLT pipelines and documentation. Conduct regular reviews with business stakeholders to align on KPI definitions and updates.                                                                           |
| **User Adoption / Understanding**      | Provide comprehensive data glossary and documentation. Conduct training sessions for end-users on how to effectively use Databricks SQL and interpret KPIs. Embed contextual help and tooltips in dashboards. Use Databricks SQL notebooks to provide detailed explanations and examples of KPI calculations.                                     |

## 3. Cost of Ownership & Optimization

Achieving the "best cost of ownership" is a central objective of this solution. The Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides unique capabilities to optimize costs, especially when combined with a zero-copy data sharing strategy.

### 3.1. Must-Have Implementations (Critical for Best Cost of Ownership):

1.  **Unity Catalog with Delta Sharing:**
    *   **Benefit:** Enables **zero-copy data sharing** between the MAP and PS Data Platform. This is the single most impactful cost-saving mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly minimizes redundant **storage costs** for PS Data Platform (as it only stores its derived Gold layer, not MAP's Silver/Bronze). Eliminates **egress costs** associated with transferring large datasets between departments or workspaces. Reduces **redundant compute** by avoiding the reprocessing of data already canonicalized by MAP.
2.  **Delta Live Tables (DLT):**
    *   **Benefit:** Provides declarative, robust, and automated ETL pipelines with built-in data quality checks. Reduces manual engineering effort and operational overhead.
    *   **Impact:** Lower development and maintenance costs. By using **triggered DLT pipelines** for batch processing of KPIs, compute resources are only consumed when new data needs to be processed, leading to substantial cost savings compared to continuous processing or always-on clusters.
3.  **Databricks Workflows:**
    *   **Benefit:** Automates and orchestrates the execution of DLT pipelines and other batch jobs, ensuring reliability and efficiency.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces operational costs associated with manual task scheduling and monitoring. Helps ensure compute resources are only activated when required by the workflow.
4.  **Serverless Databricks SQL Endpoints:**
    *   **Benefit:** Provides highly optimized, auto-scaling query serving capabilities that can scale down to zero when idle.
    *   **Impact:** Drastically reduces idle compute costs for BI/analytics workloads and ad-hoc queries, offering highly efficient resource utilization.
5.  **Comprehensive Metadata & Access Control (Unity Catalog):**
    *   **Benefit:** Enhances data discoverability, ensures data trust, and enforces secure access.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces time spent by data consumers (analysts, business users) in finding and understanding data, thereby improving their productivity. Mitigates compliance risks by ensuring data is accessed only by authorized personnel, avoiding potential fines.

### 3.2. Good-to-Have Implementations (Can be Deferred/Avoided to Reduce Initial Cost):

These functionalities offer value but can be postponed or implemented in a simpler form initially if the primary goal is cost reduction.

1.  **Advanced Machine Learning Models for Correlation & Prediction:**
    *   While valuable, developing and operationalizing complex ML models (e.g., deep learning for subtle correlations or predictive maintenance) involves significant data science effort and continuous compute resources.
    *   **Cost Avoidance:** Start with simpler statistical analysis or heuristic-based correlation identification. Introduce advanced ML only when clear business value and ROI justify the additional investment.
2.  **Dedicated External Data Catalog Solutions:**
    *   While enterprise data catalogs (e.g., Collibra, Alation) offer extensive features, Unity Catalog's native capabilities for metadata management, lineage, and discovery are very strong.
    *   **Cost Avoidance:** Initially, leverage Unity Catalog Explorer and well-documented Databricks SQL notebooks to serve as the data glossary. Integrate with external tools only if mandated by broader organizational standards later.
3.  **Custom Data Product UI/API Gateway:**
    *   Building a bespoke user interface or a sophisticated API gateway for external programmatic access.
    *   **Cost Avoidance:** Initially, serve data primarily through Databricks SQL Endpoints (for direct query access) and existing BI tools. Develop custom interfaces only if direct API access becomes a critical requirement for integration with other applications or for external customer offerings.
4.  **Real-time Streaming KPIs:**
    *   Implementing a continuous DLT pipeline for true real-time KPI updates.
    *   **Cost Avoidance:** If triggered batch processing (e.g., hourly or even 15-minute updates) adequately meets business needs for OEE, avoid the higher complexity and continuous compute costs associated with true real-time streaming DLT pipelines.

## 4. Customer Cost Model (If Exposing to External Customers)

Should the PS Data Platform decide to expose its KPI platform or specific data products to external customers, a well-defined cost model will be essential. This model must balance the value delivered to the customer, our operational costs, and desired profit margins.

### 4.1. Core Principles for Customer Costing:

*   **Value-Based Pricing:** Pricing should reflect the business insights and operational value customers derive from the KPIs, rather than just raw data volume.
*   **Tiered Service Offering:** Implement different tiers to cater to varying customer needs, usage patterns, and budget levels.
*   **Transparent Cost Drivers:** Clearly communicate the factors that influence pricing, helping customers understand their bills.
*   **Scalability:** The cost model should gracefully scale as customer usage and data consumption grow.

### 4.2. Potential Cost Model Components:

1.  **Base Access Fee (Tiered Subscriptions):**
    *   **Concept:** A recurring monthly or annual fee for platform access and a baseline set of features/data.
    *   **Example Tiers:**
        *   **Basic:** Access to core KPI dashboards, daily data updates, limited historical data retention (e.g., 3 months), 1-5 users.
        *   **Premium:** Includes Basic features plus more granular data updates (e.g., hourly), extended historical data (e.g., 1 year), access to specific line-level details, 5-20 users, basic API access.
        *   **Enterprise:** All Premium features, custom KPI development options, dedicated support, extensive API access, longer data retention (e.g., 5+ years), unlimited users, predictive insights.
    *   **Cost Drivers:** Number of users, number of factory sites/lines monitored, specific features enabled.

2.  **Data Volume / Refresh Rate Surcharges (Optional, Tier-Dependent):**
    *   **Concept:** Additional charges for customers requiring very high data volumes or refresh rates beyond the standard offering.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Standard data refresh (e.g., 4 times daily) included in base tiers.
        *   Hourly refresh: +X% to the base fee.
        *   Near real-time (e.g., <15-minute latency): +Y% to the base fee, reflecting the higher continuous compute cost of DLT pipelines.
    *   **Cost Drivers:** Direct reflection of your Databricks DLT compute costs for more frequent updates.

3.  **Data Retention Surcharges:**
    *   **Concept:** Charge for storing historical data beyond a standard retention period included in the base tier.
    *   **Example:** 1 year of historical data included. Each additional year incurs a per-GB or fixed monthly fee.
    *   **Cost Drivers:** Directly tied to your cloud provider's Databricks Delta Lake storage costs.

4.  **Custom KPI Development / Integration Fees:**
    *   **Concept:** A fee for developing and maintaining specific KPIs not included in the standard product, or for bespoke integrations with customer systems.
    *   **Cost Drivers:** Reflects your data engineering and development team's time and any incremental compute/storage required.

5.  **API Access / Data Export Fees:**
    *   **Concept:** Charges for programmatic access to the data (e.g., via a REST API) or for bulk data exports.
    *   **Example:** Per-API call fee, or a fixed monthly fee for a certain number of API calls. A per-GB fee for large data exports.
    *   **Cost Drivers:** Your compute costs for API endpoints (e.g., Databricks Model Serving or an external gateway) and cloud provider egress costs for data exports.

6.  **Premium Support Tiers:**
    *   **Concept:** Offer varying levels of technical support with different response times and dedicated resources.
    *   **Cost Drivers:** Reflects your customer support team's resources and time.

### 4.3. Translating to Databricks Operational Costs:

To build an accurate customer cost model, you need to tie it back to your internal Databricks operational costs:

*   **Compute Costs:**
    *   **DLT (Gold Layer):** Estimate average DBU/hour consumption for your DLT pipelines (especially for triggered pipelines). This will scale with the volume of raw data processed and the complexity/frequency of KPI calculations across your customer base.
    *   **Databricks SQL Endpoints:** Estimate average DBU/hour for serving queries. Serverless endpoints provide better cost efficiency due to auto-scaling to zero, making it easier to estimate based on actual query volume and complexity.
*   **Storage Costs:**
    *   **Gold Layer Data:** Accurately calculate the storage cost (per TB) for your Gold layer. Factor in the varying data retention policies for different customer tiers.
*   **Egress Costs:**
    *   Monitor data egress from your cloud provider. While often negligible for internal analytics, this can become a significant factor if customers frequently download large datasets or utilize external APIs that result in data transfer.
*   **Operational & Development Costs:**
    *   Factor in the salaries of your data engineers, data scientists, and operations staff, as well as costs for monitoring tools and platform maintenance. These fixed costs should be amortized across your customer base.

By combining a flexible, tiered pricing model with a robust understanding of your underlying Databricks resource consumption, the PS Data Platform can establish a sustainable and attractive cost model for its Manufacturing KPI Data Product when extended to external customers.
